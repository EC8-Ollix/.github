## Objective

PBL project for the Computer Engineering course. 

This project aims to develop a management platform for Helical Helixes installed on highways, for the generation of sustainable energy.

Our application provides a platform for customers to request Helical Propellers, and also manage the Helical Propellers already registered and installed.

In it, there is the Customer Profile and the Administrator Profile. From which the customer can request new propellers, and the administrator can approve or reject these requests, and schedule the installations, which once carried out, the customer will be able to view them on their platform
and collect insights from the Energy Generation carried out
